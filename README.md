## Description

This application is a employee-manager database system. What that means is, its a organized system to keep track of employees, what department, salary, and who their managers are. Some things I struggled with making this application was getting the employee table to function without getting foregin key errors, another problem I had was making sure inquierer was functioning properly with the sql databases as well as the prompts.
